;;; In the normal implementation of swank (so, the common lisp one, or even the
;;; clojure one), the evaluation thread only evaluates stuff. However, in this
;;; version, the evaluation thread does more: basically all the things pass
;;; through this thread, since it's the only one that can access the namespace
;;; currently in use.
